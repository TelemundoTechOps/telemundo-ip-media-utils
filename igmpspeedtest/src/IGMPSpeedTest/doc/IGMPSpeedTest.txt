IGMPSpeedTest - measures IGMP JOIN and LEAVE performance

This application operates as a signal generator and a signal analyzer.

One instance emits 1-254 multicast streams, while another instance
issues IGMP JOINs to those streams and measures how long it takes for the network
to begin data delivery on each stream.

The receiving application can also measure LEAVE performance, but this currently
is not an accurate measure of network performance, because the Windows
operating system stops delivering multicast packets to the application long
before the network stops delivering packets to the host.  
(TODO - fix in 1.0 by hiding the LEAVE from Windows)

Notes:  
 - The emitter and receiver must run on different servers to avoid multicast
loopback problems
 - Measurement accuracy varies across servers and networks, but it reported by
the application.  High resolution timers are used, so sub-milliscond accuracy is
expected in most environments.


Usage:  IGMPSpeedTest [OPTIONS]
  -l, --local=VALUE          IP address of local NIC to use (default: 127.0.0.1)
  -n, --network=VALUE        IP class C multicast network to listen within (default: 230.8.97)
  -c, --count=VALUE          Number of multicast streams to test (default: 1)
      --leave                Include IGMP LEAVE tests (warning: does not accurately show network traffic)
  -r, --receiver             This instance will JOIN the stream instead of emit the stream.
  -t, --timeout=VALUE        Duration (in seconds) to wait for data to arrive on multicast before quitting (default: 5)
      --ttl=VALUE            Time to live for emitted packets (default: 32)
  -q, --quiet                Just do it, dont ask.
      --json                 Output results in JSON
  -h, --help                 Show this message
